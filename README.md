# Learning Java 🎆

Hey! I'm trying my hand in Java and thought I'd take you along the journey. 
As I learn and test out new methods, functionality, and get the hang of it this repo
will get updated!

## Why Java? 🤔

As I try to expand my knowledge in the software industry and apply for internships & jobs. I've
taken a notice in the amount of times Java has been requested by name. I've always heard of it
and finally decided that it was about time I try to learn a thing or two about it.

## How Am I Learning It? 📚

I'm not taking any in-person or online classes to learn Java. Rather I've started small and simple,
with a book called '*Java in easy steps*' (7th edition) by Mike McGrath (The programs in the repo come from this book).
Summed up it's been helping me cover the basics from working in command line, variables, classes, 
& OOP and going as far as how to create an interface and even deploy the programs I make. So far 
I'm about 75% through the book and I feel like I have a great foundation to build off of. It's 
even served as a pleasant reminder on how to work with C# since most of the syntax is fairly similar.

## What's Next After? 🛣️

Once I'm done with the book, I plan to turn a game I have on my portfolio site into a small app.
While I continue to work alongside the book I also plan to make another game to practice and
cement what I've learned with Java.

Those are the most Java focused plans I have at the current moment. Otherwise everything else
I work on will continue to focus on either my portfolio site or perhaps another project that may
inspire me and require my attention.
